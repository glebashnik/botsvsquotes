I'm not vicious really. I consider myself kind-hearted. I love my mum.
I'll probably die by the time I reach 25. But I'll have lived the way I wanted to.
Well, you know, like, I don't really give a fuck what the general public think.
American audiences are just the same as anybody else. Except a bit more boring.
You just pick up a chord, go twang, and you've got music.
All I did was cash in on the fact that I'm good-looking and I have a good figure and girls like me.
I'm not chic, I could never be chic. I was in it from its inception.
